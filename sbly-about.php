  			SBLY began as an experiment to a single question — <b>what determines whether a story is shared on the internet?</b>
  		</p>

			<p>What we found was surprising. The tactics publishers use to attract the attention of their readers has left media in a fragile state. We found that the internet unfairly incentivizes publishers that don’t hold their reader’s best interest at heart.</p>

			<p>There has to be a better way.</p>

			<p>We believe that there are stories worth sharing every day that are getting lost amidst the noise. Our mission is to find and uncover these stories.</p>

				<p>At Sweet and Savory, we recognize the unique ability of food to bring people together. When we thought about some of our fondest memories, we realized that many of them are associated with food. Whether it was the annual Thanksgiving dinner with the family, the casual Sunday brunch to catch-up with an old friend, or afternoon baking session with the kids, food is an essential part of the human experience.</p>

				<p>Our goal is to create content that will help our audience experience food in a new way. We put an extreme amount of effort into every recipe and article so that we can empower our readers to step out of their food comfort zones. We hope that, by reading our content, our audience will be well prepared to create that next food related memory with their friends and loved ones.</p>
