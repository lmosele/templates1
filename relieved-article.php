	  		<p class="article-text-foreword">You may diligently customize your skin-care routine throughout the year, but many of us neglect the changing needs of our hair as the weather evolves outside. As summer hits, the sun, surf, and flat irons can cause damage that will stick around long past Labor Day.</p>

	  		<p>
	  			“In winter, hair can get dry thanks to the absence of moisture in the air, like from forced air,” explains Kevin Mancuso, celebrity stylist and global creative director of Nexxus. “But in the summer you’re exposed to more sources of damage that can harm the structure <a href="#" class="article-text-link">of your hair and the amount of moisture it can hold.</a>”

	  		<p>
	  			Protecting your hair against sun damage is just as important as protecting your skin. “Any source of heat is going to burn your hair and the sun will do the same: lightening the hair, making it more brittle,” warns Mancuso. “Virgin hair is always more resistant because of natural oils, but when it’s stripped with color, hot tools, etc., there’s no resistance in the outer layer. And once hair is more porous, it’s easier for damage to happen to it because it doesn’t have its natural coating.” Mancuso recommends wearing a hat whether you’re at the beach or running errands, and rebalancing hair’s hydration with shampoo and conditioner to help replenish the barrier hair naturally offers. Similar to your daily face moisturizer, a cream or serum with <a href="#" class="article-text-link">built in UV protection</a> will also counteract the damage.

	  		<p>There’s nothing more invigorating during the summer than that first dip in the ocean, but before you dive headlong into the waves, make sure your strands are well-protected. “Salt water from the ocean dries hair out because salt purges moisture, just like when you put salt on eggplant before you cook it,” explains Mancuso. “And then when it crystallizes on hair as it dries, that’s even more damaging. People say they love the crunchiness because it makes their hair feel thick and textured, but when you brush it through it’s in a more brittle condition and you can cause more damage.” Use Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisture Masque at least once a week if not every other day. Pro tip: Prep for a beach vacation by using the mask preemptively before you take off, or better yet, toss a few single-use pouches in your beach bag so you always have one handy.</p>
